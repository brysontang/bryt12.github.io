## Professional Summary

AI Systems Architect who builds infrastructure for ML at scale. Designed Kern (525K requests/month
event-driven ML service), Crystallize (rigorous experimental framework), and Synapse (fast-weight
plasticity research). Unlike typical engineers who consume APIs, I implement from first principles—
from Hebbian updates (ΔW = η(y ⊗ x)) to production Kafka pipelines.

## Philosophy

I build microscopes, then look through them. Kern was my microscope for ML infrastructure.
Crystallize was my microscope for experimental rigor. Synapse was what I saw when I looked
through both.

## Research Interests

- Fast-Weight Architectures & Hebbian Learning
- Meta-Learning & Context-Dependent Adaptation
- Mechanistic Interpretability
- Agent Identity & Provenance Protocols
- Experimental Framework Design

## Quantified Achievements

- **Synapse**: Implemented Hebbian fast-weight updates (ΔW = η(y ⊗ x)) for context-dependent adaptation
- **Scale**: Architected sub-1s semantic search across 300k embeddings
- **Agent-Native**: Transformed 150k-line legacy codebase (1400 lint → 900 type → 300 tests) so agentic coding works like greenfield
- **Optimization**: 10x query performance improvement (4s → 0.4s)
- **Safety**: 466 safe merge requests delivered with zero regressions

## Notable Work

### Synapse
A research spike exploring fast-weight plasticity, built to validate that Crystallize +
LLM-assisted development enables rapid hypothesis iteration. The architecture implements
error-modulated Hebbian updates (ΔW = η(y ⊗ x)) — but the real artifact is the workflow:
framework → theory → AI-assisted implementation → verification → next cycle.
- Repository: https://github.com/brysontang/Synapse

### Crystallize
A rigorous experimental framework for data science. Solves the "hidden state" problem of
Jupyter notebooks by treating experiments as immutable graphs with statistical verification.
Built as the structural precursor for self-learning agents to autonomously iterate on hypotheses.
- Repository: https://github.com/brysontang/crystallize
- Documentation: https://brysontang.github.io/crystallize/

### Agent Tokens Protocol
A cryptographic protocol for agent provenance. Formalizes identity via digital signatures
rather than heuristic detection, applying distributed systems theory to the emerging agent
ecosystem.
- Website: https://agenttokens.org

### Resume MCP
Your identity as an API endpoint. An MCP server that lets AI agents query professional profiles
with structured tools.
- Repository: https://github.com/brysontang/resume-mcp

### Bias in Embedding-Based Hiring (Research Leadership)
Led intern through AI fairness research. Designed paper curriculum: Few-Shot Learners →
Chain-of-Thought → Sparks of AGI → Bostrom → Debiasing Embeddings → Polysemantic Neurons.
Structured methodology (hypotheses → experiments → paper draft). Investigated gender bias
in synthetic resume retrieval. Unpublished paper on utilitarian frameworks for LLM ethics.

### Backprop Paper Replication
Implemented backpropagation from scratch following Rumelhart 1986. Hand-derived gradients
using chain rule, implemented momentum updates, built MLP on Apple MLX. No AI assistance —
just the paper and framework docs. Paper → math → code workflow.

## FAQ
